Title: Hospital Appointment Booking App – UX Activities
**Aim**

To apply UX ideation, user story creation, scenario building, task flow design, and information architecture techniques in order to improve the experience of booking a hospital appointment through a mobile application.

**Procedure**

Identified a common UX problem (complex hospital appointment booking).

Conducted Crazy 8s ideation to produce 8 low-fidelity solution ideas.

Created 5 user stories based on user personas and goals.

Developed a scenario narrative for one selected user story.

Designed a task flow diagram for a similar app task (food ordering).

Conducted a card sorting exercise and created the information architecture (site map) for a university website.

As a busy user, I want to see available time slots, so that I can book at a convenient time.

As an elderly patient, I want to use voice commands, so that booking becomes easier for me.

**Scenario**

   Riya, a 29-year-old marketing professional, begins feeling unwell at work. During her lunch break, she opens the hospital app and searches for a General Physician. The app shows available doctors and color-coded time slots. She feels relieved when she finds a 7:30 PM slot, which fits her schedule. She books the appointment and receives a confirmation and reminder notification. This reduces her stress and helps her plan the rest of her workday calmly.

**Result**

    By applying UX ideation and design methods, multiple solutions were proposed to improve hospital appointment booking. User needs were documented through user stories, a realistic usage scenario was created, a task flow was visualized, and a structured information architecture was developed. This process demonstrated how UX methods enhance usability and user experience in real-world applications.
